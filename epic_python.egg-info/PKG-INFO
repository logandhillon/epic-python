# epic-python
**E**xtremely<br>
**P**robelmatic and<br>
**I**nconvenient<br>
**C**ode<br>

for Python!

# What does it do?
EPIC for Python! adds a lot of *"amazing"* new syntax enforcements, and some *"quirky"* features! *If you have experience with Java, this will be a **little**  easier.* It's the worst of both worlds!

# How to Use
Simply install the latest release, then at the top of your Python file, type this:
```py
from epic import *;
epic.start();
```

# Current Features
- Enforce semicolons
- Block F strings (in favour of `String.format`)
- Replacement of common Python methods to seem more "Java-y"
- Replacement of common Python literals to be more like **EVERY OTHER LANGUAGE**
- A *"much better"* printing system (just try it, it's not that bad ðŸ˜‡)
- Removal of any sanity the developer may have had before using this! (yes, that's a feature)
